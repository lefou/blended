== Build file structure

_Blended_ uses `sbt 1.2.3` to build. Currently we have a bit more than 60 submodules in _Blended_, so that the build
file structure needs a bit of explanation:

* The main build file ist `build.sbt` in the root directory of the checkout. The build file is augmented with `.scala` files in the `project`-directory.

* The `project`-directory contains *exactly 1* scala file per sub module. These file can be seen as factories for sbt project references, so that each submodule scala file creates the project reference for that particular submodule.

* All submodule specific settings live in the corresponding scala file, *no exceptions (NONE !)*.

A sample scala file would be
