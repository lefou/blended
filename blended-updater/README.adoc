= Blended Updater

== Internal / Development

=== Materializing an update

** download all artifacts referenced in that config
** check checksums of all artifacts
** generate a `LauncherConfig` from the config
** restart the container

=== Config types

The `LauncherConfig` contains only locally available jars and is used to bootstrap the OSGi container. It is processed by the `blender-launcher` module.

The `RuntimeConfig` is the notion of an updateable configuration. It contains some metadata and all artifact locations as URLs.  It is processed by the `blended-updater` module. 

After a successful download and integrity check of all artifacts references in a `RuntimeConfig`, a `LauncherConfig` will be generated. All relevant metadata required to map a generated `LauncherConfig` to its producing `RuntimeConfig` will be stored in the `branding` property of the `LauncherConfig`.
