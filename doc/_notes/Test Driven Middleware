Test Driven Middleware
======================

Imagine you are working for a retail company you had to create an integration which hooks up all of 
your point of sales location to your data center. You are not only facing a wide variety of operating 
systems your platform needs to execute on, but also instable and/or slow networks ans ever-changing 
requirements. 

You have tried with several large companies - the integration specialists - promising a variety of features 
helping to solve the problem:

* Central Management
* "No programming, just config"
* Easy deployment
* No Testing Required

In our talk we are going to challenge those features based on a decade of experience implementing a 
container framework geared to be used in large heterogenous networks. We will show why the "Slideware"
will fail in the end and a test driven approach leads to success eventually. 

Based on real project requirements we will give an overview of an integration framework designed around 
automated testing, distribution and a minimal cost of ownership. The framework is open source and ready 
to use in real world integration scenarios.

Since early ages Andreas loved software development and continued to do so throughout and after his studies 
of computer science in Munich. After university he was thrown into a large middleware project in 1991 and 
never got away from the topic ever since. Over time he has worked for several large integration vendors as 
developer, architect and consultant. In 2010 he founded the WOQ- Way of Quality GmbH, a small software 
company specialising on integration projects. 

Since then the WoQ developed and open sourced their integration framework which they use in their own projects. 
Now closing in on it's 3rd major release the framework is ready for a broader audience. 

Andreas lives and works in southern Spain together with his wife Karin and his 8 dogs Pinocchio, Pequeno, Pequena,
