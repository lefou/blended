= File Repository

The Blended Management Server serves as a File Repository.

== Overview

Per convention, the files are organized as in a Maven 2 Repository under the following structure:

.Tree structure of a repository
[listing]
----
/artifacts/
+- {repoId}/
   +- {groupId}/
      +- {artifactId}/
         +- {version}/
            {artifactId}-{version}[-{classifier}].{ext}
