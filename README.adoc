This project is dedicated to provide reusable components for developing OSGI based application.
It builds on top of Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Camel, HawtIO, Akka and Spray and Domino.

The project documentation has moved to its own [github pages repository](https://github.com/woq/woq.github.io) and is live at [http://www.wayofquality.de/projects/blended](http://www.wayofquality.de/projects/blended).
We are currently busy getting the initial use cases documented. Stay tuned for more to come ...

== Build from source

We use Maven to build.
You need at least Maven 3.3.1 as we are using the https://github.com/takari/polyglot-maven[Maven Polyglot Scala Extension] to build Blended.
So, if you look for pom-Files, look for `pom.scala`.
We recommend to use Maven 3.5.0 or newer.

You can build with a simple:

`mvn clean install`

=== Generate `pom.xml` files

As most IDE's do not understand the `pom.scala` files, you can use the Maven profile `gen-pom-xml` with binds the `polyglot-translate-plugin:translate-project` goal to the `initialize` phase to generate the `pom.xml`'s.

After that, your IDE can use the generated `pom.xml`, but keep in mind to re-run the script after changes were made to the Scala files.

.Build `pom.xml` files from top level directory
----
mvn -P gen-pom-xml,build,docker,itest initialize
----

.Build `pom.xml` file in a local project
----
mvn -P gen-pom-xml initialize
----

=== IntelliJ

Newer versions of IntelliJ have support for polyglot-maven, thus you don't need to generate the `pom.xml`s at al. In fact, current IntelliJ has some issues and double-detects projects when it founds a `pom.scala` and a `pom.xml`.

=== Eclipse

The following plugins are recommended, to properly import the Maven projects.

* m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse
* Maven Integration for Scala IDE

For polyglot-maven support, you should also install the m2e-polyglot-poc plugin. It needs a present `pom.xml` in each project, but automatically updates it, when the `pom.scala` changes.


== Download  artifacts from Maven Central

You can download released artifacts including binary and source JARs from http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22de.wayofquality.blended%22[Maven Central].
