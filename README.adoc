This project is dedicated to provide reusable components for developing OSGI based application. It builds on top of Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Camel, HawtIO, Akka and Spray and Domino.

The project documentation has moved to its own [github pages repository](https://github.com/woq/woq.github.io) and is live at [http://www.wayofquality.de/projects/blended](http://www.wayofquality.de/projects/blended). We are currently busy getting the initial use cases documented. Stay tuned for more to come ...

== Build from source

We use Maven to build. You need at least Maven 3.3.1 as we are using the https://github.com/takari/polyglot-maven[Maven Polyglot Scala Extension] to build Blended.

Currently we transition the build scripts and as a result, the scipts may look a bit cluttered and unclean.

Once, we are finished with the transition, you can build with a simple:

`mvn clean install`

As mose IDE's do not understand the `pom.scala` files, you can use the `blended-build/gen-pom-xml.sh` script, which generates (and updates) a `pom.xml` file for each `pom.scala` file. After that, your IDE can use the generate `pom.xml`, but keep in mind to re-run the script after changes were made to the Scala files.

== Contribute

There are several areas on our [wishlist](http://www.wayofquality.de/jobs.html) that we need to incorporate over time or just want to look at, if some of those match your interests, why not join forces ?

== Feedback

We are keen to know what you think about Blended. What are your use cases, your wishes?

We are developing on top of OSGi and Akka. If you spot somethings that makes you want to pull your hair, https://github.com/woq-blended/blended/issues[let us know] ;)
