== Project Mission

_Blended_ provides a Scala based integration framework to easily develop component based applications on top of Akka, AkkaHttp, JMS and other communication libraries.

The _Blended runtime components_ provide a well defined environment for the user defined components and provides common services for component configuration, security services standard integrations to an enterprise level infrastructure, such as messaging services or authentication and authorization servers.

The _Blended management framework_ allows to monitor and manage a large number of distributed framework containers without sacrificing the stability of the environment when the management infrastructure is unavailable.

The _Blended test framework_ allows to execute functional cross-component tests mimicking the final container environment with minimal effort.

The _Blended integration test framework_ uses docker to create and deploy docker images from within the build process and supports the developer in creating integration tests for the final container.

====
_Blended_ is the backend for a distributed retail communication software. All components and services not directly related to the actual business components are licensed under the https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache 2.0 license].

Currently blended is in it's 3rd generation and in production since ~2014.

The next upcoming release will complete the migration to https://www.scala-lang.org/[Scala 2.12] and finalize the migration from maven to https://www.scala-sbt.org/[sbt].

== Build from source

We use `sbt {sbt-version}` to build blended.

====
The build files are *not* compatible with sbt versions 0.13.x as they intensively use the new unified syntax to reference properties.
====

As we have some shared modules between Scala and Scala.Js, `node` and `yarn` is also required on the developer machine.

After cloning the repository, simply navigate to the checkout directory and start sbt with a bit more memory (2GB or more):

```
sbt -mem 2048
```

The first start might take a moment as sbt needs to download the required dependencies.

For convenience we have defined some command aliases for sbt:

cleanPublish::
  `; clean ; coverageOff ; publishM2`

cleanCoverage::
  `; clean ; coverage ; test ; coverageReport ; coverageAggregate ; coverageOff`

=== IDE support

We use https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ] in our project and the project opens well enough in IntelliJ, though the import of the sbt file can take a moment.

====
There is an experimental support for the Scala Compile Server, https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop[bloop]. Currently we cannot use it as there seems to be an issue with loading mixed JVM / JS projects. Once that is solved, the bloop support should give a very good performance loading / refreshing and compiling the project.
