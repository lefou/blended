================

This project is dedicated to provide reusable components for developing OSGI based application. It builds on top of Karaf, Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Camel, HawtIO, Akka and Spray. 

We are currently busy getting the initial documentation going in our [wiki](../..//wiki). It's not fully documented, but it's growing ;)
