# Project Blended (formerly de.woq.osgi.java)

This project is dedicated to provide reusable components for developing OSGI based application. It builds on top of Karaf, Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Camel, HawtIO, Akka and Spray. 

The project documentation has moved to its own [github pages repository](https://github.com/woq/woq.github.io) and is live at [http://www.wayofquality.de/projects/blended](http://www.wayofquality.de/projects/blended). We are currently busy getting the initial use cases documented. Stay tuned for more to come ...

Contribute
----------

There are several areas on our [wishlist](http://www.wayofquality.de/jobs.html) that we need to incorporate over time or just want to look at, if some of those match your interests, why not join forces ?

Feedback
---------

We are developing on top of OSGi for quite some time, but Akka is a new technology for us. If you spot somethings that makes you want to pull your hair, [let us know](https://github.com/woq/de.woq.osgi.java/issues) ;)
